## 1. High-confidence

1. Monosemantic features exist, they are almost orthogonal to each other
2. A representation is made up of a linear combination of monosemantic features
3. There exists a set of basis monosemantic features that can be used to construct any representation

## 2. My inferences

1. The weight of a MLP neuron also is a linear combination of monosemantic features (medium-confidence)
2. The magnitude of a representation/weight is highly correlated to the number of present monosemantic features (low-confidence)
